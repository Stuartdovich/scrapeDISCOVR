Realtime update of induced Electric field model using DISCOVR solar parameters. 

Based on the paper "Regression-based forecast model of induced geoelectric field" (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016SW001518/full)

Excerpt: 'Regression-based (i.e., empirical) model for quantitatively predicting the upper envelope of induced E field components, 
using near-Earth measurements of solar wind plasma and magnetic field parameters as input arguments to the model'
